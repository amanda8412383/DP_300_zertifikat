    "- Running SQL Server Analysis Services (SSAS), SQL Server Integration Services (SSIS), and SQL Server Reporting Services (SSRS) on the same machine as the database engine can help maximize licensing efficiency.

    "SQL Server compatibility level has always been a database level setting. Setting compatibility level to a specific version allows for specific T-SQL keywords to be used as it also determines certain query optimizer behaviours.Microsoft has a generous support policy for SQL Server. Releases are supported for five years in primary support, and then five additional years in extended support. benefits to running on the latest release of SQL Server, including enhancements in the following categories: Performance & Security  & Availability & Query functionality\n",
    "\n",
    "- guarantee the same: Execution Plan Shape By upgrading versions of SQL Server but maintaining the same compatibility level, Microsoft guarantees that the execution plan shape of queries will remain consistent. This ensures that the performance of queries will not be negatively impacted by the upgrade. \n",
    "- no: \n",
    "    - Syntax compatibility is not specifically guaranteed by Microsoft when upgrading versions of SQL Server while maintaining the same compatibility level. While efforts are made to ensure backward compatibility, there may be changes in syntax or behavior that could impact existing queries.\n",
    "    - The elapsed time of queries may vary after upgrading versions of SQL Server, even if the compatibility level remains the same. While Microsoft aims to maintain performance consistency, factors such as query optimization and server resources can still affect query execution times.\n",
    "\n",
    "###  auto-pause\n",
    "\n",
    "- users have the ability to modify the auto-pause setting according to their needs, and it is not restricted to a fixed duration\n",
    "- The Azure portal provides the flexibility to change the auto-pause setting of a serverless SQL Database at any time. \n",
    "- The auto-pause delay feature allows you to define the period of time the database will be inactive before it is automatically paused. The auto-pause delay feature can be set up from 1 hour to seven days. Alternatively, auto-pause delay feature can be disabled\n",
    "- It is important to ensure that there are no active transactions in the database before changing the auto-pause setting. Making changes while there are active transactions can lead to disconnections and potential data loss, so it is crucial to manage the database state appropriately.\n",
    "\n",
    "### azure mi backup\n",
    "While the backup file is stored using a URL in Azure SQL Server Database Managed Instance, it is not stored as an URL itself. The URL is used to specify the location where the backup file will be stored, typically in a blob storage container.\n",
    "\n",
    "### \n",
    "- Geo-zone-redundant storage replicates data synchronously across three Azure availability zones in the primary region using zone-redundant storage (ZRS) and then replicates asynchronously to the secondary region. This ensures high availability and data durability across different zones within the primary region and in the secondary region.\n",
    "- Geo-redundant storage replicates data asynchronously to a secondary region for data durability and high availability.\n",
    "\n",
    "### automatic index creation\n",
    "The Query Store in Microsoft Azure provides insights on query plans and performance metrics, and SQL Server 2017 introduced automatic tuning, which includes features like automatic index creation. This feature allows the database to automatically create indexes to improve query performance without manual intervention.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Azure configuration of ailability groups properties\n",
    "- For all availability configurations of availability groups (AGs), an underlying cluster is required, whether or not it uses AD DS.\n",
    "\n",
    "- A load balancer is required to distribute incoming connections across the multiple replicas in an Availability Group (AG). It ensures that the listener in the AG works properly by directing traffic to the active replica.\n",
    "\n",
    "- not mandatory setting: \n",
    "    - The NSG (Network Security Group) is used to control inbound and outbound traffic to network interfaces, VM instances, and subnets. While NSGs are important for network security, they are not a mandatory component for configuring the listener in an AG.\n",
    "    - The NIC (Network Interface Card) ettings may play a role in network connectivity\n",
    "\n",
    "### index type\n",
    "\n",
    "- Filtered indexes are best suited for columns in large tables where a large percentage of the rows have the same value in that column. They allow for more efficient query performance by only indexing a subset of rows based on a filter predicate.  \n",
    "\n",
    "A practical example would be an employee table with a column called CurrentFlag, which indicates if an employee is currently employed. A filtered index with a WHERE CurrentFlag = 1,on the CurrentFlag column would allow for efficient queries of current employees.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- compressed indexes Compression is a technique used to reduce the storage space required for indexes, but it does not directly relate to optimizing query performance for specific column values.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Uncompressed indexes\n",
    "- Heap indexes\n",
    "- Clustered indexes They define the order in which data is physically stored in a table, but they may not be as efficient for queries that target specific column values in large tables.\n",
    "- Nonclustered indexes They are more suitable for improving the performance of queries that do not use the clustered index key.\n",
    "\n",
    "**note: Dynamic SQL** Dynamic SQL refers to the practice of building SQL queries dynamically at runtime based on certain conditions or parameters. This allows for flexibility in generating T-SQL statements within stored procedures or queries.\n",
    "\n",
    "**note: proxy** azure sql mi/db can keep the default of Proxy for connections from outside and Redirect for connections within Azure or configure something else.\n",
    "\n",
    "At the highest level, in Proxy mode all connections are proxied through the gateway, which acts as an intermediary between the client and the database. This helps in controlling and securing the connections to the Azure SQL Database or Managed Instance.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Redirect mode, after the connection is established and is using the gateway (redirect-find-db in the preceding figure), the connection can connect directly to the database or managed instance.\n",
    "\n",
    "**note: temporal table** Temporal Tables in Azure SQL Database provide the ability to recover deleted data by keeping a history of changes made to the table. This feature allows users to easily retrieve data that was accidentally deleted or changed.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Adaptive query processing\n",
    "- Adaptive query processing includes a number of options that make query processing more dynamic, based on the execution context of a query. \n",
    "- These features are all automatically enabled under compatibility mode 150 and require no other changes to enable.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Adaptive Joins - the database engine defers choice of join between hash and nested loops based in the number of rows going into the join. This enhances the processing of queries by dynamically adjusting the join strategy for better performance. Adaptive joins currently only work in batch execution mode.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Interleaved Execution -  multi-statement table-valued functions (MSTVF) used a fixed row estimate of either one or 100 rows, depending on the version SQL Server. This estimate could lead to suboptimal query plans if the function returned many more rows. With interleaved execution, an actual row count is generated from the MSTVF before the rest of the plan is compiled. This helps in improving query performance by reducing the overall query execution time through parallel processing.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Memory Grant Feedback - SQL Server generates a memory grant in the initial plan of the query, based on row count estimates from statistics. Severe data skew could lead to either over- or under-estimates of row counts, which can cause over-grants of memory that decrease concurrency, or under-grants, which can cause the query to spill data to tempdb. With Memory Grant Feedback, SQL Server detects these conditions and decreases or increases the amount of memory granted to the query to either avoid the spill or overallocation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### other new features introduced\n",
    "- Table variable deferred compilation Like MSTVFs, table variables in SQL Server execution plans carried a fixed row count estimate of one row, led to poor performance when the variable had a much larger row count than expected variables are now analyzed and have an actual row count. Deferred compilation is similar in nature to interleaved execution for MSTVFs, except that it is performed at the first compilation of the query rather than dynamically within the execution plan.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Batch execution mode allows data to be processed in batches instead of row by row. Queries that incur significant CPU costs for calculations and aggregations will see the largest benefit from this processing model. By separating batch processing and columnstore indexes, more workloads can benefit from batch mode processing.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Scalar user-defined function inlining In older versions Scalar functions were executed iteratively, effectively processing one row at a time. They did not have proper cost estimation in an execution plan, and they did not allow parallelism in a query plan. With user-defined function inlining, these functions are transformed into scalar subqueries in place of the user-defined function operator in the execution plan. This transformation can lead to significant gains in performance for queries that involve scalar function calls.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Approximate count distinct A common data warehouse query pattern is to execute a distinct count of orders or users. This query pattern can be expensive against a large table. Approximate count distinct introduces a much faster approach to gathering a distinct count by grouping rows. This function guarantees a 2% error rate with a 97% confidence interval.\n",
